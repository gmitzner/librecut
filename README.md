# LibreCut
A free and extensible application to cut designs with a plotter.

## Status
This application is work in progress. It's based on an older (private) version of this software.

The single parts of this application will be published as soon as they satisfy the minimal quality requirements. Nethertheless some published parts still require a major rework or at least some refactoring.

After the initial publishing of the software it should be able to plot SVG designs on a Silhouette Cameo plotter.
BEWARE: Use it at your own risk! It may damage your plotter!

At the current state of publishing the software is not usable because some important parts are still missing!
