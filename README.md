# LibreCut
A free and extensible application to cut designs with a plotter.

## Status
This software is still work in progress and many parts require a major rework or at least some refactoring. Nethertheless all parts have been published except the Android app to take pictures of the media and send them directly to LibreCut for further processing.

With the current version of this software you can plot SVG designs on a Silhouette Cameo plotter.

BEWARE: Use it at your own risk! It works for me but it may damage your plotter!

Next steps will be to clean up the mediascanner code; the marker detection is just a mess of a prototype and needs full rework.
